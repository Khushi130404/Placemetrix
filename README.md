# Placemetrix

Placemetrix is a placement prediction application designed to predict placement outcomes based on IQ (Intelligence Quotient) and CQPA (Cumulative Quality Point Average). The project leverages machine learning models to analyze and predict whether a candidate is likely to get placed.

## Features

Placement Prediction: Input IQ and CQPA to predict placement outcomes.

Data Visualization: Visualize data distributions and model performance using Matplotlib.

User-Friendly: Simple and straightforward implementation in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Built With

Python: Core programming language for development.

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for code and visualization.

## Libraries Used:

scikit-learn: For machine learning model development and evaluation.

Matplotlib: For visualizing data and results.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

NumPy: For numerical computations.
